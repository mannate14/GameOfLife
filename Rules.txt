Custom Rules for Game of Life

Rule 1: Underpopulation
If a cell is alive and has fewer than 2 neighbors, it dies due to underpopulation (subject to Rule 7)

Rule 2: Overpopulation
If a cell is alive and has more than 3 neighbors, it dies due to overpopulation (subject to Rule 7)

Rule 3: Survival
If a cell is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, it stays alive

Rule 4: Reproduction
If a cell is dead and has exactly 3 neighbors, it becomes alive

Rule 5: Revival by Aging
If a cell is dead and has been dead for exactly 6 generations, it becomes alive regardless of neighbors

Rule 6: Random Resurrection
For every 4 generations, one random dead cell becomes alive

Rule 7: No Repeat Death
A cell’s two successive death events should not share the same cause (Underpopulation/Overpopulation), no matter how many generations pass in between
