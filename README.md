## Introduction

This project implements a variant of Conway's Game of Life on a **hexagonal grid**, adding mechanics for cell aging, periodic random revivals, and preventing consecutive deaths for the same cause. The simulation is built with **Pygame** for rendering and **NumPy** for efficient array operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mannate14/GameOfLife.git
   cd Game-of-Life-HexagonalGrid
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
```

* **Draw** initial live cells by **clicking and dragging** with the mouse.
* Press **S** to **Start** the simulation and **E** to **Exit**.
* Generated frames will be saved as `output1.png`, `output2.png`, etc.

## Theory

### Hexagonal Grid to Array Mapping

In our implementation, each hexagon in the grid is mapped to a 2D array index by projecting its center onto Cartesian coordinates. By computing the row and column offsets (using the hexagon’s radius and the √3/2 vertical spacing), we can translate any hex cell into a (row, col) pair in a regular 2D array.

### Neighbour Positioning

Neighbours of a hex cell “shift” differently depending on whether the cell sits in an even‑numbered or odd‑numbered row. In the illustration below, you can see:

**Even rows**: neighbours on one side are pushed slightly right  
**Odd rows**: neighbours on the opposite side are pushed slightly left

### Rules

All of the custom rules for this hexagonal automaton are defined in [rules.txt](rules.txt)

## Visualization

Below are sample frames from the simulation:
